AI Teaching Assistant - Emotion Detection Dashboard
===================================================

This project is a Streamlit-based dashboard that monitors student emotions in real time using your webcam.
It uses a trained deep learning model to detect facial expressions and generate an engagement score based on emotional feedback.

-------------------
- dashboard.py ‚Äì Main Streamlit UI for emotion monitoring  
- video_processor.py ‚Äì Captures webcam feed and runs detection  
- model.py ‚Äì Contains face detection and emotion classification logic  
- emotion_detection_model.keras ‚Äì Pre-trained emotion detection model  
- requirements.txt ‚Äì Python package dependencies

üöÄ How to Run:
--------------
1. Install Python (3.8 or above)
